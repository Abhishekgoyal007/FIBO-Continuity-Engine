## 🎯 The Problem

Every professional creative studio struggles with this challenge:

> *"How do we generate 5–20 shots of the SAME character with the exact same look, proportions, colors, and style from different camera angles?"*

Traditional AI models fail because each generation introduces **drift** in appearance, lighting, and proportions. This makes them unusable for:
- Game character turnarounds
- Product 360° views
- Animation storyboards
- Marketing asset consistency

---

## 💡 Our Solution: FIBO Continuity Engine

We leverage **BRIA FIBO's unique capabilities** to solve multi-frame consistency:

### 🔑 How We Use BRIA FIBO

| FIBO Feature | Our Implementation |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Structured Prompts** | Capture character DNA from first generation, reuse for all subsequent shots |
| **Camera Angle Control** | Precise degree-based rotation (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, etc.) |
| **Lighting Control** | Consistent lighting direction across all frames |
| **Color Palette** | Locked color schemes for visual consistency |
| **Disentangled Generation** | Change ONLY camera angle, keep everything else identical |
| **Seed Locking** | Same seed ensures deterministic, reproducible results |

### 🧠 Technical Integration

```typescript
// First shot: Generate with full prompt, get structured_prompt back
const firstShot = await fibo.generate(fullPrompt, seed);
const structuredPrompt = firstShot.structured_prompt; // Character DNA

// Subsequent shots: Modify ONLY camera angle in structured_prompt
for (const shot of remainingShots) {
    structuredPrompt.camera.angle = shot.cameraAngle;
    const result = await fibo.generate(cameraInstruction, seed, structuredPrompt);
}
```
